This is the game call golden hook fishing, 
each player will get their card from a porker deck equally,
then keep play the card to the pool follow by the card sequence,
if the pool already contain a same card there,
then the player can get all the card between those two card,
such as if the pool already contained { HA, H2, H3, H4}(H is stand for heart) 
then Peter play diamond 2, then he can get the H2 H3 H4 and D2 back to his own deck,
there is a special situation, if the player play the card "J", if "J" is the only card in the pool, then nothing changed,  
if "J" is not the first card in the pool, then the player can get all the card from the pool, 
we take the above situation as our example if the pool is { HA, H2, H3, H4}, then Peter play "J", then he can get {HA, H2, H3, H4, J} back to his hand, and the pool now is empty
when the player finished all of his deck then who will lose.
